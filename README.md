> A simple, very minimal Minecraft server implementation in Rust.

For a simple Minecraft server that isn't supposed to do much (for example, a _limbo_ server as a fallback in a network of servers), usual server implementations based on Mojang's official server provide a lot of overhead.

That's why I've decided to write my own server implementation in Rust, which should be a lot faster and more efficient in handling very specific use-cases.

**Note:** This server is mostly meant as a learning project, not intended to be used in production. Because of this, bugs exists and the project is mostly unfinished.
